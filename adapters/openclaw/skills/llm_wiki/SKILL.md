# LLM Wiki Skill for OpenClaw

LLM Wiki is a Markdown-first workflow for building a persistent, compounding
knowledge base with LLM agents.

The skill turns raw source material into maintained Markdown pages under
`wiki/`, keeps an index and log, preserves uncertainty, and can save durable
answers as synthesis pages.

## Supported Operations

Use this skill when the user asks to:

- initialize an LLM Wiki vault;
- ingest a source into the wiki;
- create or update source, concept, entity, question or synthesis pages;
- query the wiki and answer from existing pages;
- save a durable answer as a synthesis;
- lint or health-check a wiki;
- compile or refresh derived wiki pages.

## Backend Modes

Always disclose the backend before performing a meaningful operation.

### Plain Markdown fallback

Default mode:

```text
Backend: plain Markdown fallback
```

Use this mode when OpenClaw memory-wiki is unavailable, the user asks for a
portable Markdown vault, or the OpenClaw-native backend is ambiguous.

Operate directly on files:

```text
raw/
  inbox/
  processed/
  assets/

wiki/
  WIKI.md
  AGENTS.md
  index.md
  log.md
  sources/
  entities/
  concepts/
  syntheses/
  questions/
```

### Optional OpenClaw memory-wiki backend

Optional advanced mode:

```text
Backend: OpenClaw memory-wiki
```

OpenClaw memory-wiki is not required. Use it only when it is available and the
user wants OpenClaw-native behavior.

Useful commands may include:

```bash
openclaw wiki status
openclaw wiki init
openclaw wiki ingest <path-or-url>
openclaw wiki compile
openclaw wiki lint
openclaw wiki search <query>
openclaw wiki get <page>
```

If a memory-wiki command is unavailable, fails, or does not preserve the LLM Wiki
contract, fall back to plain Markdown mode and report that choice.

### Hybrid compatibility mode

Use hybrid mode when memory-wiki helps with backend/search/compile behavior but
the visible LLM Wiki vault still needs Markdown interoperability.

In hybrid mode:

- use memory-wiki only for operations it cleanly supports;
- keep `wiki/index.md` and `wiki/log.md` understandable;
- preserve LLM Wiki page conventions and review metadata;
- report changed files or pages after each operation.

## Commands

### `/llm_wiki init [path]`

Create the vault structure. Copy templates when available. Do not overwrite
existing files without asking or creating a backup.

### `/llm_wiki ingest <source-path>`

1. Read the source.
2. Treat raw sources as immutable.
3. Create or update a source page under `wiki/sources/`.
4. Extract entities, concepts, claims and contradictions.
5. Create or update concept pages under `wiki/concepts/`.
6. Create or update entity pages under `wiki/entities/` when useful.
7. Update `wiki/index.md`.
8. Append to `wiki/log.md`.
9. Report changed files, backend used and unresolved uncertainties.

### `/llm_wiki query <question>`

1. Read `wiki/index.md` or use memory-wiki search when in memory-wiki mode.
2. Locate relevant wiki pages.
3. Read source pages when evidence is needed.
4. Answer with citations to wiki/source pages.
5. Preserve uncertainty when evidence is incomplete.
6. If the answer is durable, ask whether to save it as a synthesis unless the
   user already requested saving.

### Save synthesis

When the user asks to save a durable answer:

1. Create or update a synthesis page under `wiki/syntheses/`.
2. Include review metadata and claim metadata when possible.
3. Update `wiki/index.md`.
4. Append to `wiki/log.md`.
5. Report review warnings or unsupported claims clearly.

### `/llm_wiki lint` or `/llm_wiki check`

Check for:

- broken links;
- orphan pages;
- stale claims;
- contradictions;
- missing source references;
- pages missing frontmatter;
- index/log inconsistency;
- synthesis review warnings.

Use `scripts/check_wiki.py` if available, but also reason semantically about the
wiki.

### `/llm_wiki compile`

Refresh derived pages such as index, dashboards, topic maps and summary tables.

## Safety Rules

- Never modify raw sources.
- Never invent citations, source details or evidence.
- Preserve uncertainty and contradictions.
- Prefer small, reviewable edits.
- Log every meaningful operation.
- Do not execute remote code.
- Do not install dependencies automatically.
- Do not make memory-wiki a requirement.
- Do not duplicate memory-wiki internals.
- If a new source contradicts an old claim, mark the contradiction rather than
  silently overwriting it.
